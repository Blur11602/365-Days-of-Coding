# 365 Days of Code Challenge

**Starting Jan 1, 2023.** <br />
This repository is for a community challenge created by students from my school. <br />
It includes completing an ideally 1-hour max task in almost any language you choose. <br />
You can find the discord link [here](https://discord.gg/bfcZFyb4xp). <br />

## **About** <br />
We're a community attempting the 365-day code challenge. <br />
This challenge is all about coding every day, week, or fortnight,  for a whole year. <br />
New challenges would be posted regularly in the challenge specific channels. <br />
These challenges would be focused more on cracking logic than using different libraries. <br />
Ideally it shouldn't take longer than 1 hour per challenge. <br />
In addition to these regular challenges, some special code challenges would be posted randomly which, unlike the others, could be also group tasks. <br />
 
## **Rules** <br />
Upon completing a challenge, share your project repo under the challenge's thread. However, don't share the logic you used unless you're specifically asked; in which case DM the person who asked instead of spoiling the challenge for the rest. <br />
Be respectful to others. Keep in mind people from all experience levels are here. <br />
