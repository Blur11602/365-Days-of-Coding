This repository is for a community challenge created by students from my school.
It includes completing an ideally 1-hour max task in any language you choose.

**ABOUT**

We're a community attempting the 365-day code challenge. 
This challenge is all about coding every day, week, or fortnight,  for a whole year. 
New challenges would be posted regularly in the challenge specific channels: ðŸ”¥-daily-challenges ðŸ§Š-weekly-challenges âš¡-fortnight-challenges.
These challenges would be focused more on cracking logic, than using 100 different libraries, hence (mostly) any programming language could be used.
Ideally it shouldn't take longer than 1 hour per challenge.
In addition to these regular challenges, some special code challenges would be posted randomly in ðŸ’¨-special-challenges which, unlike the others, could be also group-tasks.
 
**RULES**
1. Upon completing a challenge, share your project repo under the challenge's thread. However, don't share the logic you used unless you're specifically asked; in which case DM the person who asked instead of spoiling the challenge for the rest.
2. Be respectful to others. Keep in mind people from all experience levels are here.
